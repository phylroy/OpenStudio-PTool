   ** Warning ** IP: Note -- Some missing fields have been filled with defaults. See the audit output file for details.
   ** Warning ** CheckEnvironmentSpecifications: SimulationControl specified doing design day simulations, but no design environments specified.
   **   ~~~   ** ...No design environment results produced. For these results, add appropriate SizingPeriod:* objects for your simulation.
   ** Warning ** GetHTSurfaceData: Surfaces with interface to Ground found but no "Ground Temperatures" were input.
   **   ~~~   ** Found first in surface=SURFACE 25
   **   ~~~   ** Defaults, constant throughout the year of (18.0) will be used.
   ** Warning ** CheckUsedConstructions: There are 5 nominally unused constructions in input.
   **   ~~~   ** For explicit details on each unused construction, use Output:Diagnostics,DisplayExtraWarnings;
   ** Warning ** GetSimpleAirModelInputs: ZoneInfiltration:DesignFlowRate="STORY 1 CORE ZONE DOE REF 2004 - OFFICE - OPENOFFICE INFILTRATION", Design Flow Rate Calculation Method specifies Flow per Exterior Surface Area, but Exterior Surface Area = 0.  0 Infiltration will result.

   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
